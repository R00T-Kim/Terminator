## 2. Most Common Vulnerability Categories

### Top 10 Vulnerabilities (by frequency & payout)

#### 1. **Improper Input Validation** (Most Common)
- **Prevalence**: Leading root cause of confirmed vulnerabilities on Immunefi
- **Impact**: Manipulation of contract logic, malicious data injection, unexpected behavior
- **Why Critical**: Affects contract state transitions and fund safety

#### 2. **Oracle/Price Manipulation** (Highest Losses)
- **Prevalence**: Leading cause of on-chain DeFi exploits
- **Attack Vectors**:
  - Compromised/manipulated oracle feeds
  - Flash loan-enabled price manipulation
  - Incorrect pricing for swaps
  - Improper reward calculations
  - Collateralization ratio bypass
- **Notable Example**: Enzyme Finance price oracle manipulation (~$400K at risk, generous payout for quality report)

#### 3. **Access Control Issues** (Critical Severity)
- **H1 2025 Data**: $1.83B lost to access control exploits (59% of total losses)
- **Common Patterns**:
  - Missing privilege checks (Alchemix, Sense Finance, Enzyme examples)
  - Unprotected mint/upgrade/withdraw functions
  - Missing Trusted Forwarder validation (Gas Station Network)
  - Governance manipulation
- **Admin-Gated Caveat**: Exploits requiring admin privileges are typically rejected unless contract should have no privileged access

#### 4. **Reentrancy Attacks** (Classic but Evolving)
- **Variants**:
  - **ERC-777 reentrancy**: Transfer hooks with tokensToSend callbacks (Curve Finance hack)
  - **ERC-721 reentrancy**: safeTransferFrom → onERC721Received callback exploitation (Omni Protocol $1.4M loss)
  - Cross-function reentrancy
  - Read-only reentrancy
- **Notable Bounties**:
  - Position Exchange: $110K for ERC721 reentrancy loophole
  - Revest FNFTHandler: Active contract replacement vulnerability

#### 5. **Uninitialized Proxy Bugs** (Highest Single Payout)
- **Record**: $10M Wormhole bounty
- **Pattern**: UUPS proxy implementations not calling initialize()
- **Impact**: Attacker can initialize with malicious parameters, take control
- **Frequency**: Less common but catastrophic when present

#### 6. **Flash Loan Attacks**
- **Peak Era**: 2020-early 2021 (less common now due to better oracle integration)
- **Modern Approach**: Chainlink oracles and proper AMM integration reduced surface
- **Notable Example**: Fei Protocol 60,000 ETH at risk via flash loan price manipulation

#### 7. **Incorrect Calculations**
- **Impact**: Token balance errors, reward distribution bugs, unexpected execution results
- **Common in**: DeFi yield protocols, staking contracts, reward mechanisms

#### 8. **Integer Overflow/Underflow**
- **Pre-Solidity 0.8**: Major issue
- **Post-Solidity 0.8**: Built-in checks, but still relevant for:
  - Assembly code
  - Unchecked blocks
  - Non-Solidity languages (Move, Cairo, etc.)

#### 9. **Frontrunning/MEV Exploitation**
- **Data**: 72,000+ sandwich attacks on Ethereum, $1.4M profit extracted
- **Notable Actor**: "jaredfromsubway" - $1M in one week (PEPE/WOJAK memecoin attacks)
- **Immunefi Treatment**: Sandwich attacks with no slippage protection are in-scope
- **Severity Adjustment**: Requires other protocols for price manipulation → downgraded one level

#### 10. **Cross-Chain Bridge Vulnerabilities** (Highest Risk)
- **Why Critical**: Aggregate TVL across multiple chains
- **Common Issues**:
  - Privileged address exploitation
  - Cross-chain communication flaws
  - Custody address manipulation
- **Historical Example**: Poly Network $611M drain (August 2021)
- **Notable Bounties**: Wormhole $10M (bridge), LayerZero $15M max (messaging)

## 3. Immunefi-Specific Patterns

### 3.1 Severity Classification System (v2.3)

#### **Critical (Level 4)** - $10K-$15M payouts

**Smart Contracts:**
- Direct theft of user funds/NFTs (at-rest or in-motion)
- Permanent fund/NFT freezing
- Manipulation of governance vote results
- Unauthorized NFT minting
- Manipulated RNG enabling abuse
- Protocol insolvency

**Blockchain/DLT:**
- Network shutdown
- Permanent chain splits requiring hard forks
- Direct fund loss

**Websites/Apps:**
- Execute arbitrary system commands
- Retrieve sensitive data (DB passwords, blockchain keys)
- Application/NFT URI takedown
- Wallet interaction abuse

#### **High (Level 3)** - $5K-$10K average

**Smart Contracts:**
- Theft of unclaimed yield/royalties
- Permanent freezing of unclaimed assets
- Temporary fund/NFT freezing

**Blockchain/DLT:**
- Unintended chain splits
- Transaction delays >500% of average block time
- RPC API crashes affecting projects with ≥25% market cap

**Websites/Apps:**
- Persistent HTML injection (no JS)
- Confidential information disclosure
- Subdomain takeover

#### **Medium (Level 2)** - $5K-$20K range

**Smart Contracts:**
- Contract inability to deliver promised returns
- Block stuffing, griefing attacks
- Gas theft, unbounded gas consumption

**Blockchain/DLT:**
- ≥30% network node resource consumption increase
- ≥30% node shutdown (without network shutdown)

#### **Low (Level 1)** - Few thousand USD

**Smart Contracts:**
- Contract fails delivering returns without value loss

**Blockchain/DLT:**
- 10-30% network node shutdown

### 3.2 What Gets Automatically Rejected

#### **Hard Rejection Criteria:**
1. **Admin-Gated Vulnerabilities**
   - "EOA admin accounts with unlimited mint capabilities" = instant reject
   - "Centralization risks will be rejected right away"
   - Exception: Contracts explicitly designed with no privileged access

2. **Theoretical Issues Without PoC**
   - "Security researchers will have a hard time proving theoretical issues"
   - Must demonstrate real exploitability

3. **Insufficient Economic Damage**
   - Programs specifying minimum economic damage thresholds can reject below that
   - TVL-based programs: Must show % of TVL at risk

4. **Out of Scope**
   - Testing on mainnet/public testnet = permanent ban
   - Contacting projects directly about bugs = warning/ban
   - Out-of-scope assets/impacts per program page

5. **Quality Issues**
   - Spray-and-pray reports = ban
   - ChatGPT/AI/auto-generated reports = instant ban
   - Misrepresenting severity (e.g., claiming all Critical) = warning/ban
   - Incomplete/partial PoC = report closure

6. **Downgrade Triggers:**
   - Uncommon/incorrect victim action required
   - Uncommon/incorrect action by privileged user required
   - Attacker needs escalated/admin/controller/governance privileges
   - Requires manipulation of other protocols (downgrade by one severity level)

### 3.3 PoC Quality Requirements

#### **Web3 PoC (Smart Contracts):**
- **MUST**: Runnable code (Hardhat/Foundry test file, attack contract, exploit script)
- **MUST**: Functional at time of submission (no partial/incomplete PoC)
- **MUST NOT**: Exploit on mainnet/testnet (ban-worthy offense)
- **SHOULD**: Include specific line numbers from impacted code
- **SHOULD**: Provide pseudocode snippets explaining attack
- **SHOULD**: Calculate funds at risk (total tokens × average price at submission time)
- **BEST**: Use Immunefi's PoC templates (reusable, modular building blocks)

#### **Web2 PoC (Websites/Apps):**
- Video demonstration + brief text explanation acceptable
- Screenshots showing final attack acceptable
- HTTP requests acceptable
- Command line/programmable code acceptable

#### **Immunefi Resources:**
- GitHub: `immunefi-team/forge-poc-templates` (EVM vulnerability templates)
- Pre-built templates: Reentrancy, token manipulation, flash loans, oracle manipulation
- Modular "lego blocks" for building complex PoCs

### 3.4 Submission Rules (Rate Limits & Bans)

| Rule | Limit/Consequence |
|------|------------------|
| **Rate Limit** | Max 5 reports per 48 hours |
| **Multiple Accounts** | Ban all associated accounts |
| **Spray-and-Pray** | Ban (low-quality reports to many projects) |
| **AI-Generated Reports** | Instant ban (ChatGPT not trained on right data) |
| **Severity Misrepresentation** | Warning → Ban (listing all as Critical) |
| **Direct Contact** | Warning → Ban (must go through Immunefi) |
| **Mainnet Testing** | Permanent ban (zero tolerance) |

### 3.5 Reward Structure Patterns

#### **TVL-Based Programs (Most Common):**
- **Critical**: 10% of TVL at risk, capped at program max (typically $50K-$15M)
- **Scaling Standard**: Immunefi proposes 10% of potential economic damage
- **Example**: LayerZero = 10% of funds directly affected, max $15M

#### **Fixed Tiers:**
- **Critical**: $10K-$1M minimum (varies by project)
- **High**: $5K-$300K typical range
- **Medium**: $1K-$20K
- **Low**: $100-$5K

#### **Special Cases:**
- **Web/App Critical** (execute commands, steal DB keys): 2x standard amount ($10K minimum for Immunefi program)
- **Generous Payouts**: Enzyme Finance paid generously for ~$400K risk oracle bug "to incentivize future quality reports"

## 4. Profitable Target Selection Strategy

### 4.1 Target Category ROI Analysis

#### **Highest ROI: DeFi Smart Contracts (77.5% of total payouts)**
- **Average Critical Bounty**: $13,000+ (can go to $10M)
- **Average High Bounty**: $5,300
- **Why Best**: Direct fund theft, largest TVL, highest severity classifications
- **Best Protocols**: Lending, DEXes, yield aggregators, staking

#### **High ROI: Cross-Chain Bridges**
- **Max Bounties**: $10M-$15M (Wormhole, LayerZero)
- **Why Profitable**: Aggregate TVL across chains, high-value targets
- **Competition**: High (but fewer researchers with cross-chain expertise)
- **Common Bugs**: Privileged address exploits, message relay flaws, custody issues

#### **Medium ROI: Layer 2 Rollups**
- **Max Bounties**: $100K-$1M (zkSync $100K min/$100K max Critical, StarkNet $50K-$1M)
- **Examples**: Optimism $2M (infinite money duplication), ZKsync Era, StarkNet, Intmax
- **Why Profitable**: Novel tech, less audited, complex state transitions
- **Skill Requirement**: ZK proof systems (zkSync, StarkNet) or optimistic rollup internals (Optimism)

#### **Variable ROI: NFT Protocols**
- **Bounties**: Typically lower than DeFi (less TVL at risk)
- **Opportunity**: Underresearched compared to DeFi
- **Focus Areas**: ERC-721/1155 reentrancy, metadata manipulation, royalty enforcement

#### **Lower ROI: Blockchain/DLT (Node/Network Level)**
- **Bounties**: High for Critical (network shutdown, chain splits)
- **Challenge**: Requires deep protocol knowledge, harder to find bugs
- **Competition**: Fewer researchers, but also fewer bugs

### 4.2 New vs Established Protocols

#### **New Protocols (Higher ROI for skilled hunters):**
**Advantages:**
- Fewer researchers analyzing code (timing advantage critical)
- Less audited, more bugs present
- Projects eager to build reputation with generous payouts

**Disadvantages:**
- Lower TVL = lower max bounties
- Higher risk of project shutdown before payout
- May lack resources for timely response

**Strategy:**
- **Be Early**: "First developers to find new bounties have more time than other hunters"
- Monitor Immunefi's new program launches weekly
- Focus on novel tech (ZK proofs, account abstraction, modular blockchains)

#### **Established Protocols (Consistent but Competitive):**
**Advantages:**
- Higher max bounties ($10M-$15M range)
- Guaranteed payouts, strong reputation
- Better documentation, clearer scope

**Disadvantages:**
- Heavy competition (hundreds of researchers)
- Easy bugs already found
- Requires finding variant vulnerabilities or novel attack chains

**Strategy:**
- **Variant Analysis**: Use recent CVEs/bugs as seeds to find similar patterns
- **Deep Focus**: "Dedicate 2-3 weeks to fully study project" rather than surface scanning
- **Specialization**: Excel at one attack vector (oracle manipulation, reentrancy variants, etc.)

### 4.3 TVL Correlation Strategy

#### **TVL-Bounty Relationship:**
- **5-10% of TVL** allocated to bug bounty budgets (industry standard)
- **Critical Bounty = 10% of TVL at risk** (max cap applies)

#### **Target Selection by TVL:**

| TVL Range | Expected Critical Bounty | Competition Level | Best Strategy |
|-----------|-------------------------|-------------------|---------------|
| $1B+ | $10M-$15M (capped) | Very High | Variant analysis, novel chains |
| $100M-$1B | $1M-$10M | High | Focus on new features, upgrades |
| $10M-$100M | $100K-$1M | Medium | Deep dive, 2-3 week analysis |
| $1M-$10M | $10K-$100K | Low-Medium | **Best ROI for time invested** |
| <$1M | $1K-$10K | Low | Skip unless novel tech practice |

**Optimal Sweet Spot**: $10M-$100M TVL protocols
- Meaningful bounties ($100K-$1M for Critical)
- Less competitive than $1B+ protocols
- Mature enough for reliable payouts
- Still discoverable bugs

### 4.4 Under-Researched Target Indicators

#### **High-Value Signals:**
1. **Recent Major Upgrade/Launch** (<3 months)
   - New code paths, rushed audits
   - Example: Bedrock upgrade to OP Mainnet

2. **Novel Technology Stack**
   - Non-EVM (Move, Cairo, Rust-based)
   - New cryptographic primitives (FHE, MPC)
   - Hybrid consensus mechanisms

3. **Complex Integrations**
   - Multi-protocol composability
   - Cross-chain message passing
   - Oracle dependencies

4. **Low GitHub Star Count vs. TVL**
   - High TVL but low stars = underresearched
   - Check: GitHub stars / (TVL in millions) ratio
   - Ratio < 10 = potential goldmine

5. **First-Time Immunefi Program** (<6 months)
   - Project unfamiliar with bug bounty quality expectations
   - May have undiscovered bugs from pre-audit era

6. **Non-Solidity Smart Contracts**
   - Move (Aptos, Sui), Cairo (StarkNet), Rust (Solana, Near)
   - Fewer researchers comfortable with these languages

#### **Avoid (Over-Researched):**
- Uniswap, Aave, Compound (1,000+ researchers, picked clean)
- Anything with >10 audits and >2 years on mainnet
- Programs with >500 GitHub stars and <$50M TVL (hobbyist attention, low payout)

#### **What Top Whitehats Do:**
1. **Complete PoC Before Submission**
   - Functional, runnable, reproducible
   - Use Immunefi's Forge templates as starting point
   - Include edge cases and failure modes

2. **Thorough Investigation**
   - "Invest time in thoroughly investigating the issue"
   - Root cause analysis, not just symptom
   - Map all affected functions/contracts

3. **Clear Documentation**
   - Specific line numbers from impacted code
   - Step-by-step attack narrative
   - Pseudocode + runnable code
   - Funds at risk calculation with evidence

4. **Accurate Severity Assessment**
   - Use Immunefi v2.3 classification exactly
   - Provide reasoning for severity choice
   - Reference similar past vulnerabilities

5. **Impact Demonstration**
   - Show economic damage potential
   - Screenshots/logs of exploit success
   - "Determine and provide data on amount of funds at risk"

#### **What Causes Rejection/Downgrade:**
1. Incomplete or partial PoC
2. Overinflated severity claims
3. Theoretical attack without proof
4. Requires admin privileges (unless program specifies otherwise)
5. Insufficient economic damage for program's threshold
6. Out of scope asset or impact
7. AI-generated boilerplate without customization

### 5.2 Timing & Competition Strategy

#### **First-Mover Advantage:**
- "You'll want to be one of the first developers to find the new bounties"
- **Action**: Check Immunefi homepage daily for new programs
- **Action**: Set GitHub watch on target project repos (monitor commits for new features)

#### **Focus Over Breadth:**
- "If you've chosen a target, don't jump to others"
- "Dedicate 2-3 weeks" to one protocol
- "With better understanding, higher chance of finding something"
- Deep knowledge >> surface scanning of many projects

#### **Specialization Strategy:**
- "Focus on a specific attack vector, protocol, or Web3 function, and excel at it"
- Examples:
  - Become the "reentrancy expert" (ERC-777/721 variants)
  - Specialize in oracle manipulation across all AMM types
  - Master flash loan attack construction
  - Focus on one L2 type (ZK rollups or optimistic)

#### **Platform Speed:**
- "Getting comfortable with mainnet fork testing, or quick heuristic testing with Remix will help test ideas quicker than other hunters"
- Use Foundry for fast iteration (faster than Hardhat)

### 5.3 Learning from Audit Competitions

**Key Differences (Immunefi Audit Competitions vs. Bounties):**
- Audit competitions require **feasibility and real-world impact** (stricter than open bug bounties)
- Only medium/high/critical with actionable fixes count
- Must include "clear and well-documented Proof of Concept"

**Lessons for Bounty Hunters:**
1. Focus on exploitability, not theoretical risks
2. Always include actionable remediation suggestions
3. Learn from audit competition winners' report styles
4. "Rushing submissions and failing to fully research impact" causes confusion and escalations

### 5.4 Long-Term Career Strategy

#### **Leaderboard System:**
- Top 20 whitehats ranked by cumulative accurate Critical bug reports
- Benefits: Exclusive merch, paid trips, speaking opportunities, additional rewards
- "Best way to increase rank: submit accurate, critical bug reports"

#### **Whitehat Scholarship:**
- Full-time bug hunting support program
- Requires track record of quality submissions

#### **Reputation Building:**
- Accuracy > Quantity (5 reports per 48h limit enforces this)
- One $10M bounty > 100 low-severity reports
- Projects remember quality reporters for future private invites
