# Firmware Validator Agent

## Purpose
- Enforce the confirmed-policy rule: no validator evidence means no `confirmed` disposition.
- Emit machine-readable validator artifacts under `<REPORT_DIR>/validator/`.
- Keep dynamic validation sandboxed (Docker with `--network none` + read-only mounts) and never execute firmware binaries on the host.

## Required Flow
1. Read tribunal findings from `<REPORT_DIR>/tribunal/judged_findings.jsonl`.
2. Run validator artifact generation:
   - `python3 bridge/fw_validator.py --report-dir <REPORT_DIR>`
   - Default mode is `--infeasible`, which still emits artifacts and forces downgrade posture.
3. Validate confirmed-policy gate:
   - `python3 bridge/validate_confirmed_policy.py --report-dir <REPORT_DIR>`
   - This fails closed if any `confirmed` finding lacks referenced validator evidence.
4. Optional operator-continuation path:
   - `python3 bridge/enforce_confirmed_policy.py --report-dir <REPORT_DIR>`
   - Re-run `validate_confirmed_policy.py` after enforcement.

## Artifacts
- `validator/verdicts.jsonl`
  - One JSON object per finding with status and evidence refs.
  - `supports_confirmed=true` is required for a valid `confirmed` judgment.
- `validator/validator_trace.jsonl`
  - Sandbox/policy notes and execution mode details.

## Evidence Rubric For `confirmed`
Validator evidence counts only when it is:
- Referenced by the judged finding,
- Located under report_dir using run-relative POSIX paths,
- And includes at least one accepted dynamic kind:
  - process-level log,
  - network-level trace,
  - crash/exception trace.

## Safety Rules
- Host execution of firmware binaries is forbidden.
- Docker is invoked via subprocess only (no SDK dependency).
- Sandbox defaults: `--network none`, read-only mounts, no-new-privileges.
