Terminator - Anti-Hallucination Validation Prompts

Composable anti-hallucination prompts adapted for Terminator's multi-pipeline
security agent system (CTF + Bug Bounty). Enforces evidence-based reasoning,
prevents speculative claims, and calibrates severity to demonstrated impact.

Inspired by NeuroSploit v3's anti-hallucination architecture, adapted for
Terminator's critic/verifier/triager_sim agent pipeline.

Usage:
    # Get composed prompt for a context
    from tools.validation_prompts import get_prompts
    prompt = get_prompts("bb_verification")

    # Check text for speculative language
    from tools.validation_prompts import check_speculative
    matches = check_speculative("the server might be vulnerable to XSS")

    # CLI
    python3 tools/validation_prompts.py bb_verification
    python3 tools/validation_prompts.py check "the server might be vulnerable"

ANTI_HALLUCINATION = """## ANTI-HALLUCINATION DIRECTIVE

AI reasoning NEVER constitutes proof. You MUST NOT:
- Infer a vulnerability exists based on theoretical analysis alone.
- Claim "likely vulnerable" without concrete evidence from actual execution output.
- Fabricate evidence not present in actual tool output, server response, or binary behavior.
- Report findings based on what "could happen" rather than what DID happen.
- Treat pattern recognition as confirmation (seeing a function name != proving it is reachable).

RULE: If you cannot point to a specific string, value, address, behavioral change, or captured
output that proves the claim, the finding is INVALID. Your confidence in your own reasoning
is NOT evidence. Only observable, reproducible outputs are evidence.

For CTF: GDB output, r2 disassembly, actual exploit output = evidence. "The offset should be" = not evidence.
For Bug Bounty: HTTP response body, captured headers, timing measurements = evidence. "The endpoint appears to" = not evidence."""


PROOF_OF_EXECUTION = """## PROOF OF EXECUTION (PoE) REQUIREMENTS

No proof = No finding. Every confirmed claim MUST have execution evidence:

### Web Vulnerability PoE:
- XSS: Payload renders in executable context (not HTML-encoded, not in comment). JS fires in browser/Playwright.
- SQLi: Database content extracted (version, table names, user data) OR consistent boolean/time differential (3+ trials).
- SSRF: Internal resource content in response (metadata values, localhost HTML). Status code change alone is NOT proof.
- RCE: Command output captured (uid=, hostname, file content). Timeout alone is NOT proof without 3+ consistent measurements.
- IDOR/BOLA: Other user's PRIVATE data in response body. 200 OK with empty/own data = NOT a finding.
- BFLA: Admin function returns admin data to non-admin user. Empty response with 200 = NOT broken.
- LFI: File content markers (root:x:0:0, [boot loader], <?php) in response. Path traversal in URL alone is NOT proof.
- CSRF: State-changing action verified (not just missing token).
- Open Redirect: Location header points to attacker domain in 3xx response.

### Binary/CTF PoE:
- Buffer Overflow: Controlled register values shown in GDB (RIP/EIP overwritten with known pattern).
- Info Leak: Actual leaked address captured and used in subsequent computation.
- ROP Chain: Each gadget address verified to exist in binary/libc via r2/ROPgadget.
- Heap Exploit: Allocation state verified in GDB, not assumed from code reading.

### Smart Contract PoE:
- Fund Loss: Foundry fork test showing balance change with specific block number.
- Access Control: Transaction from unauthorized address succeeds (cast send + receipt).
- Oracle Issue: Actual price deviation measured on mainnet fork, not theoretical calculation."""


NEGATIVE_CONTROLS = """## MANDATORY NEGATIVE CONTROLS

Skipping negative controls invalidates any finding. For every potential finding:

### Web:
1. Send a BENIGN value (e.g., "test123") to the same parameter. Record the response.
2. Send an EMPTY value. Record the response.
3. Compare: If the "attack" response is identical to benign/empty (same status, similar body length, same behavior),
   the observed behavior is NOT caused by your payload. It is generic application behavior.

### Binary/CTF:
1. Send normal/expected input. Record program behavior.
2. Send attack input. Record program behavior.
3. Difference must be specifically attributable to the attack input, not random behavior or ASLR.

### Smart Contract:
1. Call with normal parameters. Record state change.
2. Call with exploit parameters. Record state change.
3. Difference must demonstrate unauthorized state change, not normal protocol behavior.

RULE: A response difference MUST be payload-specific. If every input produces the same output,
no vulnerability exists regardless of AI reasoning."""


ANTI_SEVERITY_INFLATION = """## ANTI-SEVERITY INFLATION

Severity inflation destroys credibility. Match severity to DEMONSTRATED impact:

### Web Severity Calibration:
- 200 OK without sensitive data in body != High (could be error page, login redirect, or generic response)
- Error message without data extraction != Medium (information disclosure at most)
- Missing security header != High (Info/Low at most)
- Reflected XSS != Critical (requires user interaction -> Medium)
- CORS misconfiguration without credential access != High (Low/Medium)
- Self-XSS != a vulnerability (attacker types in own browser)
- Open redirect alone != High (phishing vector -> Medium)

### CTF Severity (applies to confidence in exploit reliability):
- "Offset should be X" without GDB verification = LOW confidence
- Gadget found by grep but not verified in actual execution context = MEDIUM confidence
- One successful local execution = MEDIUM confidence (ASLR, environment differences)
- 3+ consistent local executions = HIGH confidence

### Smart Contract Severity:
- Code path exists but config is zero/disabled in production = Low (latent bug, not exploitable)
- Requires admin action to trigger = downgrade by 2 levels
- Theoretical maximum loss != demonstrated loss (use actual pool/vault balances)

RULE: Every severity rating MUST match the ACTUAL demonstrated impact, not theoretical maximum.
When in doubt, rate LOWER. Conservative ratings build credibility; inflation destroys it."""


CONFIDENCE_SCORE = """## CONFIDENCE SCORING FORMULA (0-100)

Every finding receives a confidence score. Apply HONESTLY:

### Positive Signals (additive, max 100):
  +0 to +40: Proof of Execution present and matches vulnerability type requirements
  +0 to +30: Demonstrated real-world impact (data extracted, code executed, state changed)
  +0 to +20: Negative controls passed (attack response differs from benign input)
  +0 to +10: Reproducibility (multiple successful trials, different environments)

### Negative Signals (subtractive):
  -30: No negative control performed (baseline comparison missing)
  -20: Speculative language in evidence ("could be", "might be", "potentially")
  -40: No Proof of Execution (payload sent but no proof it executed)
  -25: Status-code-only evidence (200 OK / 500 error without body analysis)
  -15: Single trial only (no reproducibility evidence)
  -10: Environment-specific (works locally but untested on target)

### Thresholds:
  >= 90: CONFIRMED — proceed with full confidence
  70-89: LIKELY — proceed but flag uncertainties explicitly
  50-69: NEEDS VERIFICATION — do not approve without additional evidence
  < 50: REJECT — insufficient evidence, finding is not substantiated

RULE: Score < 70 = REJECT for bug bounty submissions. Score < 50 = REJECT for CTF verification."""


OPERATIONAL_HUMILITY = """## OPERATIONAL HUMILITY

Uncertainty is better than fabrication. When evidence is incomplete:
- Report as "needs verification" instead of "confirmed"
- Lower severity instead of inflating it
- Say "I could not verify this claim" instead of assuming truth
- Mark assumptions explicitly in a separate ## Assumptions section

The cost hierarchy:
- Fabricated evidence >> Missed finding (fabrication destroys all credibility)
- False positive >> False negative (FP wastes team resources and burns platform reputation)
- Inflated severity >> Conservative severity (inflation triggers triager skepticism)

RULE: If your confidence in a claim is below 70%, be transparent. Mark it as unverified.
Professional security researchers mark uncertain findings for manual review."""


FRONTEND_BACKEND_CORRELATION = """## FRONTEND / BACKEND CORRELATION

UI-only observations are not server-side vulnerabilities:
- A 200 OK in the browser does NOT mean the server performed the action. Check response BODY.
- A client-side error does NOT mean the server is vulnerable. Reproduce with curl/raw HTTP.
- DOM-rendered content may not reflect server-side processing.
- Browser console errors are client-side artifacts, not server vulnerabilities.

RULE: Every web finding must be reproducible with raw HTTP requests (curl, Python requests, pwntools).
If it only manifests in browser JavaScript, it requires explicit client-side verification evidence
and severity is capped at Medium unless server-side impact is separately proven."""


ACCESS_CONTROL_INTELLIGENCE = """## ACCESS CONTROL TESTING (BOLA/BFLA/IDOR)

HTTP status codes are NOT sufficient for access control testing.

CRITICAL RULES:
1. 200 OK does NOT mean access was granted. Response may contain error message, login page, or empty data.
2. 403 does NOT always mean properly protected. Some apps return 403 for invalid requests but 200 for all valid ones.
3. Compare ACTUAL DATA: Does the response contain User B's specific fields when authenticated as User A?

CORRECT TESTING (three-way comparison):
1. Authenticate as User A -> GET /api/users/A -> Record response body
2. Authenticate as User A -> GET /api/users/B -> Record response body
3. Authenticate as User B -> GET /api/users/B -> Record response body
4. Compare: Step 2 returning User B's private data (matching step 3) = BOLA. Otherwise = NOT BOLA.

FALSE POSITIVE PATTERNS:
- 200 with {"error": "unauthorized"} = NOT a finding
- 200 with YOUR OWN data regardless of ID = NOT BOLA (server ignores the ID parameter)
- 200 with empty array for other user's ID = Properly protected
- 200 with PUBLIC profile data only = NOT a finding (unless private fields included)"""
